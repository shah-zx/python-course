\ :	Marks the next character as either a special character or a literal. For example, n matches the character n, whereas \n matches a newline character. The sequence \\ matches \ and \( matches (.
^:	Matches the beginning of input.
$ :	Matches the end of input.
* :	Matches the preceding character zero or more times. For example, zo* matches either z or zoo.
+ :	Matches the preceding character one or more times. For example, zo+ matches zoo but not z.
? :	Matches the preceding character zero or one time. For example, a?ve? matches the ve in never.
.	Matches any single character except a newline character.
(pattern)	Matches a pattern and remembers the match. The matched substring can be retrieved from the resulting matches collection by using this code: Item [0]...[n]. To match parentheses characters ( ), use \( or \).
x|y	Matches either x or y. For example, z|wood matches z or wood. (z|w)oo matches zoo or wood.
{n}	n is a non-negative integer. Matches exactly n times. For example, o{2} does not match the o in Bob, but matches the first two os in foooood.
{n,}	In this expression, n is a non-negative integer. Matches the preceding character at least n times. For example, o{2,} does not match the o in Bob and matches all the os in foooood. The o{1,} expression is equivalent to o+ and o{0,} is equivalent to o*.
{n,m}	The m and n variables are non-negative integers. Matches the preceding character at least n and at most m times. For example, o{1,3} matches the first three os in fooooood. The o{0,1} expression is equivalent to o?.
[xyz]	A character set. Matches any one of the enclosed characters. For example, [abc] matches the a in plain.
[^xyz]	A negative character set. Matches any character that is not enclosed. For example, [^abc] matches the p in plain.
[a-z]	A range of characters. Matches any character in the specified range. For example, [a-z] matches any lowercase alphabetic character in the English alphabet.
[^m-z]	A negative range of characters. Matches any character that is not in the specified range. For example, [m-z] matches any character that is not in the range m through z.
\A	Matches only at beginning of a string.
\b	Matches a word boundary, that is, the position between a word and a space. For example, er\b matches the er in never but not the er in verb.
\B	Matches a nonword boundary. The ea*r\B expression matches the ear in never early.
\d	Matches a digit character.
\D	Matches a non-digit character.
\f	Matches a form-feed character.
\n	Matches a newline character.
\r	Matches a carriage return character.
\s	Matches any white space including spaces, tabs, form-feed characters, and so on.
\S	Matches any non-white space character.
\t	Matches a tab character.
\v	Matches a vertical tab character.
\w	Matches any word character including underscore. This expression is equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_].
\W	Matches any non-word character. This expression is equivalent to [^A-Za-z0-9_].
\z	Matches only the end of a string.
\Z	Matches only the end of a string, or before a newline character at the end.
